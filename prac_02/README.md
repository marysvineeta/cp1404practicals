## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
100$

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch them at home in the evenings after work

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

testing my programs properly before submission. I also make sure my code is readable and uses each function effectively.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving practicals until the last minute. I’ll start doing them earlier in the week so I have more time to work on it and ask for help if needed.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I often skip writing comments and docstrings because I focus too much on getting the code to work. I’ll start documenting my programs properly so they’re easier to understand and maintain.


## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I’m following good coding practices, such as using constants, meaningful variable names, and functions with single responsibilities.
