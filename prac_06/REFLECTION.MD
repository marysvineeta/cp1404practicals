# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I realised I was rushing through tasks without fully understanding them, so I’ve started slowing down and actually reading the instructions carefully before coding. I now try to test my code step-by-step instead of waiting until the very end.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my time management. I tend to leave practical work until the last minute, which affects the quality of my learning. I also need to be more consistent with practice instead of only working when deadlines are close.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am asking for help when I don’t understand concepts and reviewing feedback instead of ignoring it. I am also getting better at debugging and not giving up immediately when I hit errors.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on copy-pasting and start writing more code myself, even if it’s slower. I also need to stop panicking when something doesn’t work and approach problems more logically.
## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

More real-world examples and practical scenarios would help make the concepts clearer and more engaging. It would also be helpful to have more guided practice sessions for students who struggle with the basics
