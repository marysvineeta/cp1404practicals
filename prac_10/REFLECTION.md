# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were often too messy at the beginning. I tended to underestimate how long tasks would take, especially when they involved debugging or learning a new concept at the same time.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the subject progressed, my estimates became more realistic. I started factoring in extra time for problem-solving and unexpected errors, which helped my predictions become closer to the actual time spent.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that planning is important and that coding almost always takes longer than expected. The process helped me understand my working pace and made me more mindful of time management.
## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I did not receive much direct feedback because I was late for most of my practical classes and therefore missed several peer review activities. This made me realise the importance of attending on time, as I missed opportunities to learn how others critique and improve code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Since I was not regularly present for these sessions, I did not get to actively participate in structured code reviews as much as I should have. However, it showed me that being involved in reviews is important for improving both technical understanding and communication skills.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

Not applicable – I did not complete formal peer reviews due to late attendance in practical sessions.

### Explanation

Missing these activities helped me understand that consistency and punctuality directly affect learning outcomes and professional development.

### Good Code Review 2

Not applicable – I did not complete formal peer reviews due to late attendance in practical sessions.

### Explanation

This highlighted the need for better time management and participation, as code reviews are a valuable learning tool.
## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would introduce slightly more guided examples for complex topics, as some were challenging for beginners. A short walkthrough before harder tasks would make learning smoother.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I stayed consistent with completing tasks each week and made an effort to fix errors properly instead of ignoring them. I also improved at structuring my code and following clean coding principles as the semester progressed.

### What do you still need to improve?
One major area I need to work on is committing my work more regularly. I often forget and delay commits, which means my version control history is not as consistent as it should be. I need to develop the habit of committing after each milestone instead of leaving it until the end.
