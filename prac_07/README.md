The purpose of this repository is to track my learning, apply clean coding principles, and build a good coding style.


## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout this subject, I have learned several important principles about writing clean and maintainable code:

* Writing meaningful variable and function names makes code easier to understand and debug.
* Keeping functions short and focused improves readability and reusability.
* Consistent formatting, spacing, and indentation greatly enhances code clarity and professionalism.
* Avoiding repetition by using functions and classes follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle.
